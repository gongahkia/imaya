## Reference

The name `Imaya` (今や) is [Romaji](https://japanese.fandom.com/wiki/Romaji), often understood to mean "now" in [Kanji](https://japanese.fandom.com/wiki/Kanji). 

However, 今や *(imaya)* differs from the more commonly used 今 *(ima)*. While 今 *(ima)* is generally used to refer to the current moment in various contexts, 今や *(imaya)* specifically highlights the contrast between the past and the present, emphasizing the significance of the here and now against the backdrop of transformation from a prior condition.
