# `Imaya` ü´ó

What will you do ‰ªä„ÇÑ?

## Rationale

[I am my own greatest enemy](https://i.imgflip.com/3fahyh.png) when it comes to using [task management apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1au1uzj/whats_considered_the_best_app_for_taskproject/).  

More than once, I have found myself [anxious](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/xa7hll/do_any_of_you_feel_overwhelmed_by_productivity/) after opening that day's to-do list, just to discover [46 things](https://preview.redd.it/a604rad7j4651.png?auto=webp&s=63112b65e516d3e19dcbd05489d09967a2d73dce) scheduled for completion.  

*(Just to be clear, this is not in any way the fault of those apps. This is mostly a result of poor time management.)*

It became clear to me that what I needed was a tool that let me [cut through the noise](https://preview.redd.it/80gsl73buxld1.png?auto=webp&s=939fed7c6043148153dde311683defce1f568287) and choose which tasks to prioritise. 

With those considerations in mind, I created [Imaya](https://github.com/gongahkia/imaya).

## Usage

> [!TIP]  
> See [here](#get-started) to get started quickly.  

### Overview

In Imaya, tasks are sorted categorised into [3 pools](#pools) of water.

Imaya limits you to choosing 1 task from each sized [pool](#pools) everyday, for a total of 3 tasks. Aim to complete all [3 pools](#pools) by the end of the day.

Plan the order in which you complete tasks by checking out Imaya's reccomended [flows](#flows).

### Pools

#### üíß Stream

Streams represent **small tasks** that are generally gentle and manageable for an easy win.

They could be an administrative task or personal time for your mental wellbeing.

#### üèû River

Rivers represent **medium** tasks that require a moderate amount of energy and focus, but not all of your attention.

This translates to secondary assignments or tasks with light problem-solving.

#### üåä Ocean

Oceans represent **large** tasks that demand deep focus.

This means tasks that call for as little distraction as possible, including meetings and primary assignments.

### Flows

#### üê∏ Eat that frog 

*Eat that frog* is taken from [Brian Tracey's book of the same name](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/?srsltid=AfmBOorL_u1oLNVS80Ait_zgS9oCp8MXX8nHKl-RjJsG4vp4EBfqtz6Z).

Start with the [LARGE task](#-ocean), then the [MEDIUM task](#-river), then the [SMALL task](#-stream).

#### üóª Climb the summit 

*Climb the summit* provides a balanced approach to your day.

Start with the [MEDIUM task](#-river), then the [LARGE task](#-ocean), then the [SMALL task](#-stream).

#### üèÉüèº Slow burn 
        
*Slow burn* is the perfect flow for those who prefer a slower start to their day.

Start with the [SMALL task](#-stream), then the [MEDIUM task](#-river), then the [LARGE task](#-ocean).

### Get started

Our favourite way to use Imaya *(and what we recommend you do)* is extract the 3 most pressing tasks from your to-do list each morning, and slot them into Imaya.

*Avoid [to-do list fatigue](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1bmjltj/big_todo_list_low_energy_levels_what_to_do/).* You are able to schedule up to 9 tasks every day, but Imaya restricts you from suffering from the [ill effects of overambition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1e5r7fc/how_to_get_over_disappointments_about_tasks_not/).

*Start every week on a fresh slate.* You are able to check the tasks you have completed for the current week, but Imaya will forget them once the week is over. 

| Task type | Focus level | Time | Context | Example |
|------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Stream (small) | Light, habitual | 15-30 minutes | Administrative or wellbeing | Clear emails, yoga session, file documents |
| River (medium)| Balanced, analytical | 45-60 minutes | Project-orientated, incoming, process-based | Email campaign, schedule social media, finish presentation |
| Ocean (large) | Creative, intense | 90+ minutes | Deliverable-oriented | Write report, edit video, project deliverable |

Each time you complete a task pool, you'll learn about your limits and what best fits your workflow, so if you notice yourself completing pools often, feel free to increase the density of the task inside them for better results.

## Reference

The name `Imaya` (‰ªä„ÇÑ) is [Romaji](https://japanese.fandom.com/wiki/Romaji), often understood to mean "now" in [Kanji](https://japanese.fandom.com/wiki/Kanji). 

However, ‰ªä„ÇÑ *(imaya)* differs from the more commonly used ‰ªä *(ima)*. While ‰ªä *(ima)* is generally used to refer to the current moment in various contexts, ‰ªä„ÇÑ *(imaya)* specifically highlights the contrast between the past and the present, emphasizing the significance of the here and now against the backdrop of transformation from a prior condition.
